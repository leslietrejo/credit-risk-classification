# credit-risk-classification  
-Using the lending data csv file with loan data on healthy loans and high risk loans (for applicants) we use 2 regression models and compare the accuracy of the 2 models using accuracy score, precision, and recall
-Our results show quite the discrepancy between the 2 models
-We include working code chunks and analysis text chunks regarding the methodology and accuracy of each model
